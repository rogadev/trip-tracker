# Trip Assistant

I built a quick little trip tracker to track my contracts with Granny Go Go over the summer of 2021. This helps me keep tabs on how many trips I did and how much money I've potentially made each month.

## Frontend

Vue 3 without UI framework (for now).

## Backend

Node backend using mongoose, cors, and express.
